Flip Plan:
==========

needs:

- sheets
- history/back-stack management
- navigation
- handy annotations for sheets
- state saving and restoring
   serialize history/back-stack
   serialize inner widget state
- separation between view and controller/presenter

wants:
 - provide activity sub class to manage single container of any type
    do not assume a single pane container

Sheets:
 - are an extension of a ViewGroup/FrameLayout
 - have basic lifecycle management methods
 - are dynamically inserted/removed from a flip container (folder? cabinet?)
 - can contain sheet containers
   - there should only be one main history tracker, so it can not be a integral part
      of the container code. history class of some sort?

Container:
 - contains one or more Sheets
 - can be subclassed to do a sliding pager, or side-by-side pane layout, etc

History:
 - back and forward options?
    treat it like a undo/redo stack?
 - potentially have a extensible History implementation
    it could allow providing a "history" object to the main container
    and a custom tracker could do things like wrap an adapter or cursor type thing
    to dynamically traverse the "Stack"
 - each element in the stack should not just be a single sheet change
    it must be able to track multiple sheets, including embeded sheets.
    each element will be a group of changes
